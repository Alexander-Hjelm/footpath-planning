Notes from meeting with Chris:
Footpath importer
    Sketch based interface, moving points
    Base it on ExampleRoads
    -> Generate a new prodecural road with footpaths
    footpaths can be very close/alomst overlapping. Problem
    Ask Todor how this would be used by urban planners
    TODO: Update Project specification, leave unsure areas empty



Möte med chris 17/10:
    Specify more detail in everything
    For MVP:
        Specify some scenarios (geographical areas), single intersection, single block, entire neighbourhood
            Generate stright street, curved street, single intersection, single street with footpath, etc...
    Push the document to google
    Specify that we are only looking at 2D, no road intersection if the nodes are not connected
    Add a Timeplan to the planning document
    Dates:
        MVP features
        Evaluations ready
        A full draft of the report
        Thesis presentation, 1 week after full draft
        Batches tend to happen early may-mid may, second in september
    
    Wait for a week with iteration on evalutation/questionaries
    Any quantifyable metrics for quality? Similary metrics?
        Similarity to surrounding area

    User questionarie for similarity between generated/existing parcels
        Keep it as a stretch goal for evaluation
    Focus on quantifiable metrics first, look at existing papers
        Mesh complexity
        Geometry

    Chris's previous student, look at evaluation
    Read through this:
    http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1375175&dswid=-7274

    Procedural Footpath Generation
    http://www.csc.kth.se/~chpeters/ESAL/studentprojects.html
    https://projectfharlanghn.wordpress.com

    A group of master's students who do project work for Chris, maybe ask him about this later
    
    Bachelor's thesis, maybe I can look at methods of evaluation
    http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1215852/FULLTEXT01.pdf

    Keep track of all the references we use for the literature review later

    Start writing on the background/Introduction sections

    Constraits, Delimitations, good to specify the projects more
        (no roundabouts?)

Mail, 22/01
Hi again!


Updated master's project specification here. Could you read it through and give me your immediate thoughts? I don't reckon we need to schedule a meeting for that.


The main additions are the evaluation metrics, constraints, scenarios and time plan.


As for the evaluation plan, I decided not to include any user studies yet. Just programmatic evaluations and quantifyable metrics. My main idea is to sample metrics about intersections only (number of connecting roads, the angles between them, distance to connecting intersections, curviness of roads, etc). If I can sample all that and create a distribution for a few different cities, I have the two following hypothesises:
  1. There should be selection of features that produce an observable difference in the distributions between cities that look vastly different.
  2. If I let my program generate a large number of city parcels from a dataset, the resulting feature distribution should look like to the source dataset, and unlike datasets of other cities.
These distributions could be created for primary, secondary roads and footpaths separately.


What do you think? Could this be a reasonable approach?

Frågor till nästa möte:
- Använde XINGJIANG YUs paper för generering av vägmeshes. Kan jag citera det eller borde jag hitta en akadmisk källa?
- Finns det någon LaTeX-template?

    FWDa projectspecifikation till Ann till Jonas Beskow
    Fråga Todor: Standard widths, road widths + footpath widths, what ways are there to infer them?
    OSM: Infer footpath width from nearest buildings (building footprint)
    How do we make a best guess of footpath width
    Building footprints
    Average footpath width in the whole stockholm
    Pass 1: Convert to a 3D mesh and measure the paths for which there are collision with other map elements
    Go out physically and measure road withs changing
    Ask Todor: Is there a detailed database for path widths in Stockholm? Do urban planners go out and physically 
    GIS: Height data. Get a heightmap of buildings for footprints+terrain.
    Find out what default width OSM uses for paths
    Motivation: AI agents, they might fail navigating when faced with a too narrow path or intersecting obstacles
    Record a video of the demo

Möte med Chris 12-03-20
    Some areas good be well reconstructed, some not. Inconsistent matching between datasets.
    Think of some method to determine how realtistically fasible the comparison process between datasets is.
    A contribution to the paper: Evaluate the similarity between OSM and SLU datasets, basic analysis of the similarity between datasets, this reduces risk of the project. A good inclusion in the project
    Perceptual error metrics, quantitative error metrics in LOD. Use such metrics to evaluate the difference in datasets.
    Will have to do some research to find a quantitative metric
    E-mail Filip Biljecki: Talk about the common metrics used, anyone that is good for my project? Use quick question. Do you know any work in the area of reconstructing paths?
    Look at his PHD thesis: Level of detail in 3D city models
    Look at this paper: The most common geometric and semantic errors in CityGML datasets
    Hugo Ledouxs paper: Applications of 3D city models: State of the art review <- read this, look for evaluation methodologies. Geoinformation might have better methodologies than visualization

Email från Todor, 11/05:

You can maybe add few more references about procedural modelling and subsequent work. These are two classical texts:
Parish, Y. I., and Müller, P. (2001) Procedural modeling of cities. In Proceedings of the 28th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, SIGGRAPH, 12-17 August 2001, Los Angeles, Calif. pp. 301-308.
Müller, P., Wonka, P., Haegler, S., Ulmer, A., & Van Gool, L. (2006). Procedural modeling of buildings. In ACM SIGGRAPH 2006 Papers (pp. 614-623).

I really like the works of Carlos Vanegas who describe the relationship between streets, lots and buildings (as fundamental elements of urban form):
Vanegas, C. A., Aliaga, D. G., Wonka, P., Müller, P., Waddell, P., and Watson, B. (2010) Modelling the appearance and behaviour of urban spaces. Computer Graphics Forum, 29(1), pp. 25-42.
Vanegas, C. A., Kelly, T., Weber, B., Halatsch, J., Aliaga, D. G. och Müller, P. (2012) Procedural generation of parcels in urban modeling. Computer graphics forum 31(2), pp. 681-690.

5. You can also check few references about 3D- GIS e.g.
https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/11/503/htm
I think the work of Biljacki is also important with LOD (Level of Detail).
Biljecki, F., Ledoux, H., & Stoter, J. (2016). An improved LOD specification for 3D building models. Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, 59, 25-37.
Biljecki, F., Ledoux, H., Stoter, J., & Zhao, J. (2014). Formalisation of the level of detail in 3D city modelling. Computers, environment and urban systems, 48, 1-15.

Möte med Chris 13/05:

Send email to Jonas Beskow, send a project specification, what week I would like to present, is he available? Sorry that I didn't get around earlier
Find the old project specification that I sent to Ann and pass it on to Jonas
Mention in the abstract that the implications for the fields is a scientific contribution. Scientific analysis.
Turn it into a set of recommendations. How would you take this work and apply it? What are the challenges?
Potential application: a cheap method of generating cities.
Main challenge: How to reconstruct a 3D city.
Inlude more papers to show how my paper integrates with this main challenges (Building footprint, LOD levels, building heights). Footprint extraction already made.
Fan: A lot of the metrics that I've used apply not only for roads but for buildings as well.
Update background with main story: How to recontruct cities from footprint data on the cheap.
Abstract: Is concise but needs shortening (a couple of paragrahs), should contain the main challenge, reconstructing 3D cities.
Exjobb thesis, format. https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/report-template-2/
Read through process: https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/working-process/
Bold main research question: Road network reconstruction
Merge 2.1, 2.2. Add a sentence about where the question fits into the big picture
    Add "See sections XX and XX for implementation and results"
Optional: Strategic images with captions (Vitural city). Sneak in some details about the big pictures
Reduce long subsection headings
Rename analysis -> conclusions
Very first introduction (very very basic, layman).
    Here is a virtual city
    Consisting of road network, buildings, details
    Roads have different types
    Importing data from online databases
    What aspect of this am I working
Have a look at other thesises: How does the abstract and introduction look, how are they structured?

Möte med Chris 27/05:

Improve connectivity between first two paragraphs in the abstract
How do better footpaths relate to better accuracy?
Section 3 could go into the background chapter (Not just the data used in this projects, geodata in general) (Describe geodata GIS in general, and why these two datasets were chosen)
    Reword the headers
    Move related work
Move talk about the specific geodata to the implementation
    Talk also about these specific geodata sources in Implementation
    Generally about what sources are available in Background
Move 4.1 -> Evaluation/Methodology (new section?)
At the beginning of each chapter, give the reader an overview (why am I telling you this, how does it fit in in the report in general?)
    First I present X and Y, this will be used as part of Z or to define ZZ
Move Conclusions -> a new part 2 of Results and Metrics, write a new conclusions and future work section. The new Results/Metrics 2.0 should contain the meat of the analysis related to the data.
    New conclusions and future work, step out and remind the reader of what the broad implications in the field is by the results
Here's the research questions: (list of 1, 2 sentences), then use the following paragraphs to motivate why the questions are important, specify the subquestions and the metrics
Email Ann Bengtsson, coordinate opponents, formalities of attending 2 other presentations?
