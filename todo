Presentation to report:
    Clarify why I did the collision study the way I did
        Distance less than the accuracy to preserve the logical consistency to the map + aestetic characteristics, both between features and in the map as a whole

Which might be why some of these services have not gained the traction they have hoped for (bankrupcy)

Urban planning: Research projects have a case-by-case nature, need to implement datastructures and fit data to your own model

Root of this projects: ESAL does crowd simulation by the nature of the indnstry means car roads are at the focus (ecological, self driving cars + games)

Constraint: Building are assumes to be coherent to their footprints along the z axis, no taper

Remove maximum estimate, add notes about the minimum footpath estimate, and that it was towards the maximum and not minimum. No recommendation exists from STA

DP: Vertexes represent building features, parts of buildings

Make clear that the accuracy estimate methods are based on the Fan paper

Shape accuracy: invariant to linear transformations of the polygon, so will ignore any linear errors of the dataset as a whole and only focus on the unsystematic ones due to measuring precision
