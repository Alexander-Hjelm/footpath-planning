READ PAPERS:

Generating 3D City models without elevation data, Filip Biljecki
    Used footprint area and footprint complexity to estimate building height
    Footprint complexity = Area of perimiter between the footprint and the cirle with the same area as the footprint

Viewpoint: City information modeling (CIM) and Digitizing urban practises
(Todor's manifest about interactive urban modelling, under review)
Mentions a few services that reconstructs cities from geodata, use this as related work

F Biljecki: Level Of Detail in 3D City Models
    Chapter 11, p 231: Sensitivity of LOD to positional errors
    Refers to the papers: Propagation of positional error in 3D GIS, Error propagation in the computation of volumes in 3D city models with the Monte Carlo method
    p. 235: 
        One may define a maximum acceptable uncertainty of the result of an operation, and by performing the analysis of the propagation of uncertainty within the operation may reversely determine the maximum allowed uncertainty in the input data.
        Describes a few different use cases for calculating the error propagation of Geospatial data
        Uses Monte Carlo method

Once we find out how to measure GIS input error, we can use this to determine the output error in road placement

F Biljecki: THE MOST COMMON GEOMETRIC AND SEMANTIC ERRORS IN CITYGML DATASETS
    Tolerances for coordinates and planarity (p. 15): Points that span neighbouring boundary surfaces may not be in the exact same location, so a snapping tolerance is introduced
    VALIDATION OF THE SEMANTICS OF BUILDINGS: For 3D geospatial data, the orientation of an element can be verified by taking the normal of a surface.
    Used quality metric: The percentage of invalid surfaces in the entire model (for validation of 3D geospatial data)

Least square fit of 2D geodata? And add the mean error to the road width (x2, one for road placement and one for the building placement) and see how the number of intersections changes.
Are neighbouring boundary surfaces interesection or non-watertight?

M. Over: Generating web-based 3D City Models from OpenStreetMap: The current situation in Germany
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971510000402
    Lists the accuracy requirements in some common application areas (CityGML Standards)
    Investigates which CityGML standard accuracy requirements can be fulfilled
    Takes the Visualization standpoint
    Building footprints are mostly digitized from aerial or satellite imagery. Legal agreements with online map providers allow mappers to use some high-resolution imagery for deriving vector data. In this case, the accuracy of the digitized building footprints depends on the resolution of the provided orthophotos and satellite images.
    Section 7 offers some good comments on OSM data quality
    Claims that OSM building footprint data is collected by tracing satellite images, which have a certain resolution

    https://kfrichter.org/crowdsourcing-material/day1/haklay10.pdf
    Page 685 provides some accuracy classes (Positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, completeness etc)
    Page 686 has a comment on masimum resolution of GPS and OSM
    Page 688 describes the methodology of determining the similarity between two datasets. The metric they used is: The buffer zone method, described in Figure 1.
    Page 688 also comments on the issue of measuring features with a different amount of points
        The buffer size was set to 20m, since this is the resolution of their source dataset (What is the resolution of SLU?)
        In our case: Go over all buildings, calculate the individual overlap (buffer method), calculate the average building overlap and the variance.
    Might have to note that the building footprints are completely covered by both the OSM and SLU datasets, thus solving the issue of completeness.
    SLU dataset does not contain road data
    Page 690 shows that for datasets where the amount of points are the same, they simply take the distance between the points as the error, and calculate the average and variance from this
    Page 692: The completeness was taken as the difference of the sum of road lengths in either dataset

    newest (2014)
    Introduction says that sattellite data came from Bing
    Focuses specifically on building footprint data
    Good related works!
    Related works section: Claims that bigger urban areas "inherit" many more contributers, and thus are better mapped
    Mentions a related work that uses area comparison to estimate quality
    Map matching:
        Koukoletsos et al. (2012) proposed a feature-mathing algorithm specifcially for OSM that incorporates both geometric data and attribute data. SLU contains no attributes, however.
    Similarity matching by using Turning Function
        Invariant to rotation and scaling
    Page 6 has a nice illustration showing the possible displamenet errors in building footprints
    Uses difference in total building area to asses completeness, this avoids the semantic error that some buildings may be merged in one dataset but not in the other. Nothing is right or wrong here.
        To avoid this semantic issue when counting vertices, compare building by building, then keep the larger building in the dataset if there are vertices that have yet been unmatched.
    Mentions position accuracy, just like M. Haklay
        For our project, maybe we could identify buildings with the same number of points by evaluating the closest points, if the closest point is in some threshold distance e.
        Asses the completeness question by counting the number of buildings whose centerpoints and area are roughly the same (within some tolerance), then pull both buildings from both datasets and continue.
    Section 4 describes an algorithm to find corresponding points
    Search area was reduced by storing buildings in grid cells of 15x15m, by their centroids, then searching the current and neghbouring cells
    For semantic accuracy (1-on-1 building matching) they used a structure where they allowed multiple buildings to be matched to one another.
    Includes max, min, average and deviation of poisitional accuracy
    Turns out OSM building footprints are very simplified, which gives a difference in the turning function
    Page 16 describes neccessary normalization of the area and perimiter data
