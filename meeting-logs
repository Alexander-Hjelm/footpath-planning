    For MVP:
        Specify some scenarios (geographical areas), single intersection, single block, entire neighbourhood
            Generate stright street, curved street, single intersection, single street with footpath, etc...
    Push the document to google

        Thesis presentation, 1 week after full draft
        Batches tend to happen early may-mid may, second in september
    
    Wait for a week with iteration on evalutation/questionaries
    Any quantifyable metrics for quality? Similary metrics?
        Similarity to surrounding area

Mail, 22/01
Hi again!


Updated master's project specification here. Could you read it through and give me your immediate thoughts? I don't reckon we need to schedule a meeting for that.


The main additions are the evaluation metrics, constraints, scenarios and time plan.


As for the evaluation plan, I decided not to include any user studies yet. Just programmatic evaluations and quantifyable metrics. My main idea is to sample metrics about intersections only (number of connecting roads, the angles between them, distance to connecting intersections, curviness of roads, etc). If I can sample all that and create a distribution for a few different cities, I have the two following hypothesises:
  1. There should be selection of features that produce an observable difference in the distributions between cities that look vastly different.
  2. If I let my program generate a large number of city parcels from a dataset, the resulting feature distribution should look like to the source dataset, and unlike datasets of other cities.
These distributions could be created for primary, secondary roads and footpaths separately.


What do you think? Could this be a reasonable approach?

    Think of some method to determine how realtistically fasible the comparison process between datasets is.

Email från Todor, 11/05:

You can maybe add few more references about procedural modelling and subsequent work. These are two classical texts:
Parish, Y. I., and Müller, P. (2001) Procedural modeling of cities. In Proceedings of the 28th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques, SIGGRAPH, 12-17 August 2001, Los Angeles, Calif. pp. 301-308.
Müller, P., Wonka, P., Haegler, S., Ulmer, A., & Van Gool, L. (2006). Procedural modeling of buildings. In ACM SIGGRAPH 2006 Papers (pp. 614-623).

I really like the works of Carlos Vanegas who describe the relationship between streets, lots and buildings (as fundamental elements of urban form):
Vanegas, C. A., Aliaga, D. G., Wonka, P., Müller, P., Waddell, P., and Watson, B. (2010) Modelling the appearance and behaviour of urban spaces. Computer Graphics Forum, 29(1), pp. 25-42.
Vanegas, C. A., Kelly, T., Weber, B., Halatsch, J., Aliaga, D. G. och Müller, P. (2012) Procedural generation of parcels in urban modeling. Computer graphics forum 31(2), pp. 681-690.

5. You can also check few references about 3D- GIS e.g.
https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/11/503/htm
I think the work of Biljacki is also important with LOD (Level of Detail).

    First I present X and Y, this will be used as part of Z or to define ZZ
Move Conclusions -> a new part 2 of Results and Metrics, write a new conclusions and future work section. The new Results/Metrics 2.0 should contain the meat of the analysis related to the data.
    New conclusions and future work, step out and remind the reader of what the broad implications in the field is by the results
Here's the research questions: (list of 1, 2 sentences), then use the following paragraphs to motivate why the questions are important, specify the subquestions and the metrics

Email from Chris 05/06:

Hi Alexander,

I'm looking at the version here:
https://github.com/Alexander-Hjelm/footpath-planning/blob/master/report/report.pdf
I'm not sure it has changed since we last met, so please double check.

But the background section still seems very short - I think you were going to move
some of the text from the 'method and evaluation' section in there and the rest
of that text into the implementation and evaluation sections (perhaps either
relabelling the implementation section to 'method' or else create a method
subsection within the implementation section). Also, the delimitations should
be a subsection in the introduction section.

Best,
Chris

Email from Chris 08/06:

Hi Alexander,

The table of contents is looking a lot better now and I really like your introduction and conclusion
sections. They are quite comprehensive than many other theses. One thing I might ask you
is to add slightly more descriptive text below the main research questions to explain/clarify
it a bit. This may involve reiterating/summarising a bit what you already mention in 1.2, but try
to really spell it out for the reader.

Otherwise, the main things that stand out to me still are that the backrgound and evaluation sections are
looking a bit short in the table of contents. Partly, I think that is because each of the final subsections
(specifically, 2.4 and 4.2) in those sections have quite a few pages, but do not have further subsection
headings within them, so there is an impression that those sections are shorter than they are.

Do you think you could add some subsection details in the table of contents? The main rule is that
each section should have at least two subsections within it, so you may need to add one or two new
ones for content that is already there. Let me know if that makes sense.

But also, section 2.3 seems important and could be extended further (perhaps adding some
more references: 25-30 would be ideal).

Other things:
1) In your background section, perhaps mention briefly for each topic at the end of it, how it relates
to the your thesis/work.
2) For apps/code such as Github geojson viewer, perhaps add the url as a footnote.

Best,
Chris

Email from Chris 15/06:

Hi Alexander,

Thanks for the ping: The table of contents and structure is looking good to me!
But I think you should do another iteration to improve the overall clarity,
focussing on the core concepts and terms. It's not bad at the moment, but just
to make it easier to read at the beginning (since I think a reader not already familiar
with it may grapple with a few aspects and have to read more deeply to try to figure
them out).

1) The concepts of collisions, errors and overlaps. I think you need to get the whole
concept across in a clearer and more consistent way, starting in the abstract. Try and
come up with a sentence that is as short as possible and explains why overlaps might
arise in two datasets. You should repeat this a couple of times throughout the work: it
should be in the abstract, introduction and 1.3 research question. You can go into detail
about it in the introduction section and there, a clear comparison image with an
example of accurate versus inaccurate data would make the case very clear quickly.
Overlap is a more understandable term early on than collision, so I'd be inclined to use
that, perhaps 'overlap due to errors' would help to explain it. Collisions could be saved
for later as a more technical term.

2) Roads versus footpaths. I think your definition of 'road' includes 'footpaths' too. But I find
this confusing, since a footpath (or specifically, sidewalk) is usually something that runs
alongside a road. I'd advise you use different terms for road and footpath - if you do want to
consider a footpath as a type of road, you shuold make it clear early on.
It would also be good to reflect that a bit in the table of contents: although the thesis is
mainly about footpaths, that word doesn't appear in any of the section or subsection
headings in the implementation or evaluation sections.

3) Revisit the title of the report. Fans of OSM might not be happy to hear an assessment
that OSM quality is not good.

4) Same for the abstract. Reduce the first paragraph, which is really background.
Then provide more detail about what specifically was done and how it was evaluated.
"In the collision detection process..." - this sentence is a bit enigmatic, and could be
rephrased to tell us a bit more about what was compared and how. Also, perhaps include
the name of the dataset with known accuracy.

The results sentence look fine, although it would be good to mention the implications.
However, I think the contirbution of your work would look better if you also include the
method that you use to compare the datasets. That could also be a contirubtion. Could
it be used in future? What are it limitations, benefits, etc?

When are you thinking of sending it to Jonas? I think you just need to clarify it a bit more
before you send and I can't see it taking too long.

Chris
